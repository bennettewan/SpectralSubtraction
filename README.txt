How to use Spectral Subtraction Tool

This tool has two different input modes: One for processing on files, and one for processing with microphone input. To switch between the two, click the buttons on the top left section. 

A sample file has been provided for use in file processing.

The middle section of the window is for controlling how the subtraction works. The parameters have been selected to get the best output, but they are fully customizable to tweak the subtraction. At the top of this section is three different buttons which drive the subtraction.

Adaptive Estimation: Toggles whether or not the noise estimation should be updated adaptively rather than initializing the estimate to a constant.

Compute Noise Profile: If adaptive estimation is on, this toggles whether or not the estimation is getting updated. If adaptive estimation is off, this initializes a noise profile based on a small section at the beginning of the file/records a small section of audio from your microphone.

Enable Subtraction: Toggles whether or not the estimate is being subtracted.
